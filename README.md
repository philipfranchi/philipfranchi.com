# Source code for philipfranchi.net

This is the source code for my personal website. It's really a work in progress, and an opportunity to learn about web infrastructure. Currently it's hosted with Elastic Beanstalk, but in the future that'll be different

## Setup
Make sure you have yarn and go on your machine, then run ./build.sh to create the zip file used to upload the repo to Elastic Beanstalk
