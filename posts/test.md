# Creating a Blog App with React and Go

This a sample test! 
Technically the same paragraph, but in the `.md` file this is all one line

Now we're on paragraph 2. It *works*. Scream it with me now. **IT WORKS** 

See these examples:

1. If it didnt work, this number `1.` on the side would not be here
2. ```This block of code would also not be here```
2. Here are some more examples
    - This is gonna show up indented
    - Also without numbers
    - *ps* bullet 3 was actually labelled 2
4. > IT WORKS
