# Creating a Blog App with React and Go
***
This a sample! I created this file to show off what we can do with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) on my website, to make blog posts. Normally you wouldn't see this but I'm developing actively

Now we're on paragraph 2. It *works*. Scream it with me now. **IT WORKS** 
## Does it really work?
I think it does. See these examples:

1. If it didnt work, this number `1.` on the side would not be here
2. ```This block of code would also not be here```
2. Here are some more examples
    - This is gonna show up indented
    - Also without numbers
    - *ps* bullet 3 was actually labelled 2
    * heres a bullet
        * and its bullet
            * \* Without the backslash, this would be another bullet
            * like this bullet
4. > IT WORKS
